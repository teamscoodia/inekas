# Online Photo Printing 

This project is a "Next.js + Tailwind CSS" web application developed as a "test task" for a client requirement.  
It showcases the core features of an "online photo printing platform", allowing users to upload photos, choose print sizes, see prices, and simulate placing an order.

The project is designed to demonstrate full-stack readiness (frontend logic, UI, and scalable structure) — but runs completely on the client side for testing and presentation.

## Project Objective

To build a simple, responsive, and dynamic web page where users can:

1. Upload up to "5 photos" directly from their device.
2. Instantly see photo "thumbnails" on the same page.
3. Choose "print sizes" (4×6, 5×7, 8×10) for each photo.
4. See "automatic price calculations" for each selection.
5. Click a “Pay Now” button that simulates checkout (no real payments).
